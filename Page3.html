    The first time I saw the word bitch was in a book about dogs. It was something about how to properly care for your bitch. 
    <br> Is being a bitchgirl contradictory? Every bitch is a girl but is every girl a bitch? This is the webpage about a girl who feels like a bitchgirl, a girl who feels like a bitch. My dog always knew the best places to sleep anyways.

    One day I went on a two hour crying rant about how much I love dogs
    <br> If I'm being honest I cannot understand most of what I said in those audio recordings because I really bawling but here are some highlights
    <br> ♡ Like- *sniffles* doggirl means so many different things to different people like *SNIFFLES* idk like doggirl to me- like the reason I resonate with dogs is because im freaking BROWN like-like-like a cat can be an asshole like a cat can bite people and scratch people and its just oh the cat is independent and you need to give the do-d-cat some space or whatever but if a dog bites you a dog freaking gets put DOWN and like thats why i- why i relate to dogs more than cats because i dont GET to be a cat and i dont GET to be independent because im mean or whatever- and- but like- but like i dont even like want to be mean- *sniffles* *sniffles* *mumuring* its just hard sometimes- i dont know- *sniffles* i like dogs- i really like dogs- and like the freaking festival in bolivia- thats so cool- i need to be in bolivia on august- like- 15th or 16th or whatever so I can see a bunch of dressed up dogs that seems great
    <br> OH WOW I ACTUALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT. August 16th in Bolivia is St. Roch's day. St. Roch was the patron saint of dogs so people take the day to celebrate our relationship with dogs. 
    <br>

    <br> ♡ i- like ohmygosh- i know so many dogs that people hate because they have annoying traits that cats are TOTALLY allowed to have- like sophie- like MY MOM is not a sophie fan because shes a brat and she will push the limits of what shes allowed to do- but you know what SHES FREAKING SMART FOR THAT- and same tbh- but like- if- if like- if a cat- she says shes like a cat for that- 
    and honestly she is like a cat but why are those considered cat traits- theyre just traits that cats are allowed to have opposed to dogs having them because dogs act like that too if theyre allowed to if theyre not HIT or BEATEN of it- like out of them- and like ladybug- and she was so loud and like she loved playing and barking at you- and like- i miss ladybug she was so sweet *pauses* sorry *gasps* um- but like my mom always said she didnt like her because like she was loud or whatever and like when you would pet her she would get so excitied and like and bark for you to pet her some more and she like would always get the zoomies and was so sweet *sniffles* like ladybug was such a sweet dog *gasps* but like people didnt like her because she was kinda annoying but i loved her like she was like-  *sniffles* like *sniffles* one of my favorite dogs ever *sniffles* and like that happens to so many dogs people just wont like them because they have these annoying little traits- and that makes me so sad like-
    like i dont know- terriers are supposed to be loud- thats what terriers are supposed to do- they were bred for that-
    <br> ♡ more people should like dogs but not like- like- oh i want an obedient little dog or whatever- like like i want a loyal animal- like in a *sniffles* *gasps* i appreciate *gasps* the dog for who they are not because they listen to you or whatever
    <br> ♡ like i get why people want to be dogs and like- like- *gasps* i dont know- i love dogs- *mumuring* and i respect the puppygirls- and like i respect the puppygirls- even if its like- and i get the want to be- whatever- same- but like- i dont even know where im going with this- i love dogs- dogs are great
    <br> This brings me to why I was crying over dogs for two hours. I ended up on the catgirl vs puppygirl side of tumblr which is FULL of puppygirls AND YEAH I GET IT- everyone loves puppies you wanna take care of puppies and who doesnt want to be taken care of- when you already get treated like a dog why would you NOT want to be a puppy- at least a puppy- so i was frustrated with this really dump 4chan post ppl were passing around about how being a puppygirl is BAD bc it means youre a submissive little pet but I felt that really REALLY didnt look into any sort of reason why underprivlidged groups would clambor to the puppygirl instead of the catgirl
    <br> I dont even feel like a puppygirl if anything I feel like a streetdoggirl but I respect the puppygirls and also the catgirls but I dont think you need to bring down someones comfort role to bring up your own especially when you think about dogs. Why do we use bitch as an insult- why is dog an insult- why is mutt an insult- why do we only value "mans best friend" when they are subservient- I think a lot of disdvantaged groups know what its like to be a dog. 
    <br>

    <br> ♡ I really love dogs *sniffles* 
    <br> I really just love dogs. I love their personalities, I love their looks, I love how relatable they are- I just love dogs- If you have a dog(or dogs) please give them a million kisses for me
